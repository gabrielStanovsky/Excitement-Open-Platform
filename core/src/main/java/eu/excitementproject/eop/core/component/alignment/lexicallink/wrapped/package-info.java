/**
 * This package holds convenient classes that wraps 
 * an instance of "lexical aligner", based on LexicalAligner class. 
 * 
 * Why provide such a wrapped lexical-aligner that only aligns based on a  
 * specific lexical resource? -- for ease of using, (e.g. oneliner) without 
 * explicitly dealing with configurations. 
 * 
 * (e.g. P1 EDA users can simply init and call annotate(), don't care much 
 * about underlying configuration file)
