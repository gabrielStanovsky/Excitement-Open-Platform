 * This package holds various template classes for Phase-1 Alignment-based EDA, which is a 
 * prototype (or a proof-of-concept) EDA which tries to build EDA as an "open" box (vs. black box).
 * 
 * How to read / access the classes in this package? 
 * 
 * (TODO fill in overview here once finished) 
 * 
 * - check p1eda.instances for running examples, such as English, German and Italian P1EDA instances.
