* The code is in:
  * ./alignmentedas/src/test/java/eu/excitementproject/eop/alignmentedas/SimpleUsageExampleEN.java

* It uses the following files:
  * Train:
  alignmentedas/src/main/resources/English_dev.xml
  * Test:
  alignmentedas/src/main/resources/English_test.xml

* Model is saved in:
alignmentedas/target/p1eda.trained.model

* Plan:
  * Format SNLI's training and test to fit the format as in the files above.
  * Run the file and see what results we get with current config.
  * Try playing with it a little bit to improve results by using different features.
